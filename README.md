## Kotlin Compose Notes and Code

This repository contains my personal notes, code samples, and hands-on practice as I learn modern Android development using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**.

I'm currently following two in-depth Udemy courses:

1. 🎯 **[The Complete Android 14 & Kotlin Development Masterclass ](https://www.udemy.com/course/android-14-kotlin-development-masterclass/)**
2. 🧩 **[Android Jetpack Compose: The Comprehensive Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/jetpack-compose-bootcamp/)**

### 🛠️ What you'll find here:
* Kotlin syntax and concept practice
* Jetpack Compose UI components and layouts
* Mini-projects and hands-on examples
* Notes and tips I pick up along the way

This is a learning-first repository — feel free to explore, clone, and learn along with me !
